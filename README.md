## Project Description
> In this project, you will use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

## Learning Goals
> Learn how to to build Single-Responsibility controllers to provide a well-designed and versioned API.
> Learn how to use controller tests to drive your design.
> Use Ruby and ActiveRecord to perform more complicated business intelligence.

## Getting Started
> After cloning down the repo, input the following commands:
* bundle
* rake db:{drop,create,migrate}
* rails import:all
> This information may take a minute to load. Please be patient. :)

## Using the API
> After you're done with the set up, check out the route, controller, and model tests and files to see how we tried different approaches to solve business intelligence inquiries for a JSON API!
